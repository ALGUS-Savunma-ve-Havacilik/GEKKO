# Notes on Gekko Gui development

## Todo
- Pretty up the graph
  - add log scale options
- Decide what to put on each graph or at least what to display by default
- check for memory leaks (could cause serious problems for operators where it may be running for months on end)
- add fullscreen modal window option for each chart
- add polling checks to frontend
  - if backend does not respond open error window
- Get tabs col ready to be used interactively
- Look into real-time plotting
