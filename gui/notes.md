# Notes on Gekko Gui development

## Questions
- Are the JSON structures pretty static or will there be field that only appear
  depending on what the user chooses? If not, can it be made static?
- Do you have a problem using bootstrap? What about using it from a CDN?


#### Difficulties with DASH
- state is difficult to manage
- requires nested list comprehension to generate table
- difficult or impossible to split into smaller files


#### Todo
- make sure the right port is displayed in the event that dash chooses something
  other than `localhost:8050`
