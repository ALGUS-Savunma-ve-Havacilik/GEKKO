## How to contribute to Gekko

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability
  in Gekko**, and instead contact Advanced Process Solutions, LLC support at support@apmonitor.com.

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/BYU-PRISM/GEKKO/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/BYU-PRISM/GEKKO/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Gekko will generally not be accepted.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in the [APMonitor mailing list](http://apmonitor.com/wiki/index.php/Main/UsersGroup) and start writing code.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use Gekko on the [APMonitor Google Forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/apmonitor) or on [StackOverflow with tag [gekko]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/gekko). StackOverflow is preferred.
